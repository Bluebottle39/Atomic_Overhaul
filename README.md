<h2>Graphite</h2>

[graphite]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fainda/images/main/Graphite.png

![graphite][] <br>
After you have researched the **graphite processing** technology, you are able to craft graphite, which will be needed to craft **graphite fuel cells**.

<h2>Uranium</h2>

[uranium]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fainda/images/main/uranium.png

![uranium][] <br>
Uranium remains as in the base game. It is used to craft fuel cells, which, when reprocessed, give **plutonium**, **research data**, and uranium-238. You will need the research data to research new technologies regarding nuclear stuff.

<h2>Plutonium</h2>

[plutonium]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fainda/images/main/plutonium.png

![plutonium][] <br>
Plutonium is not only used for crafting new fuel cells, but also for crafting the **atomic bomb** or the new **plutonium fuel**.

<h2>Mixed Oxide (MOX)</h2>

[mox]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fainda/images/main/MOX.png

![MOX][] <br>
MOX is another fuel consisting of uranium and plutonium.

<h2>Thorium</h2>

[thorium]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fainda/images/main/thorium.png

![thorium][] <br>
Thorium is, by standart, the **highest tier** of nuclear fuel. You can also use it to craft **Thorium Modules**, which increase the speed of processing/reprocessing recipes.

<h2>The Space Reactor</h2>

<img align="left" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fainda/images/main/hr-reactor.png">

The Space Reactor is a prototype of the standard reactor. It is modified to withstand the cold vacuum of space and resist cosmic radiation.

This Reactor is only placeable in space, regardless of the ground it is standing on.

Remember that **_you can only fuel it with the new fuel cells,_** each of which having its own glow as seen in the picture below.

<h2>Iridium-192</h2>

[iridium]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fainda/images/main/iridium-192.png

![iridium][] <br>
You are now able to extract the rare Iridium-192 Isotope from Iridium Powder and Sulfuric Acid inside of a Radiation facility.
Once Again, you will need it for a more powerful fuel cell with a fuel value of 17GJ.

<h2>Holmium-166</h2>

[holmium]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fainda/images/main/holmium-166.png

![holmium][]<br>

Another Isotope you are now able to extract from Holmium powder and Sulfuric Acid inside of the Radiation facility is Holmium-166. It is needed for the Holmium fuel cell with a fuel value of 21GJ.

<h2>Beryllium-7</h2>
 
[beryllium]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fainda/images/main/beryllium-7.png

![beryllium][]

Beryllium is currently the most powerful nuclear fuel you are able to obtain in this mod. The Beryllium fuel cell has a fuel value of 25GJ.
