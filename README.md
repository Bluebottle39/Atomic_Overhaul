<h2>Graphite</h2>

![graphite][] <br>
After you researched graphite processing, you will be able to craft graphite, which you will use to craft graphite fuel cells.

<h2>Uranium</h2>

[uranium]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fainda/images/main/uranium.png
![uranium][] <br>
Uranium is just like in the base game, you use it to craft fuel cells which when reprocessed give plutonium, research data, and Uranium-238. You will need the research data to research new technologies regarding nuclear stuff.

<h2>Plutonium</h2>

![plutonium][] <br>
Plutonium is not just only used for crafting new Fuel Cells, but you will need it if you want to craft the Atomic bomb or the new Plutonium Fuel.

<h2>Mixed Oxide (MOX)</h2>

![MOX][] <br>
MOX is just another fuel that consists of Uranium and Plutonium.

<h2>Thorium</h2>

[thorium]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fainda/images/main/thorium.png
![thorium][] <br>
Thorium is the last tier of nuclear fuel. But you can use it to craft the Thorium Modules, which increase the speed of processing/reprocessing recipes.
