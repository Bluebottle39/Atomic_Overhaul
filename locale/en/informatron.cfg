title_Atomic_Overhaul=Atomic Overhaul
page_Atomic_Overhaul_text_1=Atomic Overhaul is a mod for Factorio adding new nuclear fuels, recipes and technologies to the game. \n Developed by Xman1109 and fainda.

menu_AO_materials=Materials
title_AO_materials=Materials
page_AO_materials_text_1=Atomic Overhaul adds a lot of new Materials that are mostly used for new fuel cells with more efficiency than the last one.
page_AO_materials_text_2=After you have researched the [font=default-bold]graphite processing[/font] technology, you are able to craft [font=default-bold]graphite[/font], which will be needed to craft [font=default-bold]graphite fuel cells[/font].
page_AO_materials_text_3=[font=default-bold]Uranium[/font] remains as in the base game. It is used to craft fuel cells, which, when reprocessed, give [font=default-bold]plutonium[/font], [font=default-bold]research data[/font], and uranium-238. You will need the research data to research new technologies regarding nuclear stuff.
page_AO_materials_text_4=[font=default-bold]Plutonium[/font] is not only used for crafting new fuel cells, but also for crafting the [font=default-bold]atomic bomb[/font] or the new [font=default-bold]plutonium fuel[/font].
page_AO_materials_text_5=[font=default-bold]MOX[/font] is another [font=default-bold]fuel[/font] consisting of uranium and plutonium.
page_AO_materials_text_6=[font=default-bold]Thorium[/font] is, by standart, the [font=default-bold]highest tier[/font] of nuclear fuel. You can also use it to craft [font=default-bold]Thorium Modules[/font], which increase the speed of processing/reprocessing recipes.

title_SE_materials=Space Exploration + Atomic Overhaul
page_SE_materials_text_1=Space Exploration by Earendel is one of the most popular mods for Factorio. Atomic Overhaul provides additional content for this mod.
page_SE_materials_text_2=The Space Reactor is a prototype of the standard reactor. It is modified to withstand the cold vacuum of space and resist cosmic radiation. It is only placeable in space and you are restricted to our new fuel cells as a power supply.
page_SE_materials_text_3=You are now able to extract the rare [font=default-bold]Iridium-192[/font] Isotope from Iridium Powder and Sulfuric Acid inside of a Radiation facility. Once Again, you will need it for a more powerful fuel cell with a fuel value of [font=default-bold]17GJ[/font].
page_SE_materials_text_4=[font=default-bold]Holmium-166[/font] is Another Isotope you are now able to extract from Holmium powder and Sulfuric Acid inside of the Radiation facility. It is needed for the Holmium fuel cell with a fuel value of [font=default-bold]21GJ[/font].
page_SE_materials_text_5=[font=default-bold]Beryllium[/font] is currently the most powerful nuclear fuel you are able to obtain in this mod. The Beryllium fuel cell has a fuel value of [font=default-bold]25GJ[/font].
